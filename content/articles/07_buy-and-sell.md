  On-ramp and off-ramp services are a way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money quickly and easily. They provide an essential service because they significantly lower the barrier to entry for inexperienced users. Without these services, inexperienced users would be overwhelmed with the interfaces and interactions required to buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange.
