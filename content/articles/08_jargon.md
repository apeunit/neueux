summary: >-
  Jargon is the specific terminology associated with a particular field or area of activity. It is [well documented](https://doi.org/10.2190%2FJ8JJ-4YD0-4R00-G5N0) that jargon can have a negative impact on communication between professionals and laypeople. When niche words and phrases are used in applications that are intended for first time users, these unfamiliar words become meaningless jargon that provides no value. It clouds and complicates meaning, which is irritating and alienating to users, with potentially harmful consequences to all parties.
